Project Code Execution
=============

All the codes for this project are under project-code
directory. There are three directories under project-code.

   CouchDBBenchmark which contains CSV files from deployment and
    benchmarking processes.  
  couchdbansible which contains Ansible scripts
  logs which contains console output logs


 Before starting the deployment of CouchDB, user have to
perform the following preparation steps.

 * Start two Instances in Chameleon Cloud with the specification
 * Allocate floating IPs to the instance created
 * Add  security rules as mentioned under Security section
      of this report to the two instances 
 * User has to manually insert the IP addresses by modifying
      inventory.txt file which is found under project-code
      /couchdbansible directory. There are two hosts 
      defined under inventory.txt. One of the IP addresses
      goes under [couchdb_Coordination_host] section of inventory.txt
      and the second IP address goes under [couchdb_hosts].
      
      Deploy CouchDB
=============

To deploy CouchDB, on command prompt cd to project-code/ directory and run
couchdbinstall.sh as providing three parameters. 

  First parameter takes true or false to indicate whether to
    install CouchDB in single node or cluster
  Second parameter is an integer number for the value of
      replica
  Third parameter is an integer number for the value of
      shard

An example command

./couchdbinstall.sh true 3 8 


Benchmark Tests
=============

To run benchmark tests, on command prompt cd to project-code/ directory and run

./BulkLoadReadCouchDB.sh

This script performs different benchmark tests and saves all the time
durations into CSV file name starting with benchmark_under
CouchDBBenchmark directory.

Combining CSV files
=============

To combine all CSV files from benchmarking tests into one file named CouchDBfinal.csv run

./CombineBenchmark.sh 

A copy of this file is also saved under project-artifact if needed in
the future to reproduce the graphs in this project


Plotting graphs for Benchmark Tests
=============

To Plot the graphs for benchmarking analysis run the 
plotBenchmark.py script from command line as follows

python plotBenchmark.py
